# MVP Requirements

The MVP for this project will be a fully functioning web-hosted application that allows users to create and maintain detailed family histories. 
These histories will be centered around a family tree but also include stories about various family members.

The initial impetus for this project is to provide a way for our geneaology-oriented family members to store their research in a digitized way instead of creating massive family trees on paper.
However, the hope is that the project will be useful to the general public as a free and open-source alternative to popular family tree sites like Ancestry.com which have large paywalls and lots of features that aren't really relevant for this purpose.
The goal is simplicity and a focus on storing various data about the family in a meaningful way. There will be no emphasis on WHERE the data came from, or where to get more; only on storing what is already compiled.

The general approach will be a web app with an interactive frontend, including a family tree viewer and views/interactions for other pieces of data such as family stories.
All of the tree data will be stored in a backend database, and an API will be exposed that the frontend can use to query the database. This follows the general structure of most modern web apps.

## Design Decisions

### Focus on Stories

Most platforms currently in existence focus primarily on the family tree as the centerpiece, with all other data (facts, stories, audio/video, etc) added off to the side and not as accessible as the tree.

This platform will weigh all of the stories and other data equally with the tree. After all, stories are the foundation of what makes a family unique, and (in my opinion) they should be the center of any platform that tracks a family.

So, while the family tree feature set will be well-developed, it will not be developed at the expense of all other features. The focus will be on the stories about the people in the tree.

### Family != Tree

The platform will be structured around families, not around family trees. There will not be a one-to-one relationship between the two.
Users will be able to create and maintain multiple "families", and each "family" will be able to contain multiple trees.

This may not be important for all users, but I think it's important to establish that trees are not the center of the "family" structure in the platform.
If a user wants to create multiple trees within one "family" (for example, one tree for their mom's side and another for their dad's side), then they can do so--*without* having to choose where to put stories and other data.

## Task List

### Choose architectures

- [ ] Frontend: UI, API interface, how to serve pages
- [ ] Backend: DB, API, other packages/tools
- [ ] Deployment: containerization, dev/sandbox servers
- [ ] Set up dev tools: linting, formatting

### User account system

- [ ] Get basic frontend-backend communication working
- [ ] Backend system with DB schemas for registering users
- [ ] RBAC with only one role for now; will be used later in collaborative features
- [ ] User authentication system using JWT
- [ ] Frontend UX for user account management: sign up, login, view and edit account

### Creating families

- [ ] Backend DB schemas for families tied to users
- [ ] Frontend UX that allows users to create (multiple) families
- [ ] Ensure one user cannot view the families created by another user

### Create and view family trees

- [ ] Backend DB schemas for trees
- [ ] Schemas for people within trees
- [ ] UX for creating trees
- [ ] UX for creating people
- [ ] UI for viewing trees that minimizes extra clicks while still being performant
- [ ] Backend performance optimization to minimize time to load trees

### Add family stories

- [ ] Backend DB schemas for stories
- [ ] UI for adding stories
- [ ] Optional: Markdown syntax for creating and rendering stories
- [ ] Tag multiple people in each story
- [ ] UX for browsing the stories contained in a family

### Collaboration

- [ ] New RBAC roles for collaboratively accessing families
- [ ] Allow multiple users to be registered as collaborators on a family
- [ ] Invite another user to your family via special URL
