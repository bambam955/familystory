# FamilyStory MVP Requirements

The MVP for this project will be a fully functioning web-hosted application that allows users to create and maintain detailed family histories. 
These histories will be centered around a family tree but also include stories about various family members. In this way, it will become more than just another geneaology builder; it will be a living history of the *lives* that have been lived by a family.

The initial impetus for this project is to provide a way for our geneaology-oriented family members to store their research in a digitized way instead of creating massive family trees on paper.
However, the hope is that the project will be useful to the general public as a free and open-source alternative to popular family tree sites like Ancestry.com which have large paywalls and lots of features that aren't really relevant for this purpose.
The goal is simplicity and a focus on storing various data about the family in a meaningful way. There will be no emphasis on WHERE the data came from, or where to get more; only on storing what is already compiled.

The general approach will be a web app with an interactive frontend, including a family tree viewer and views/interactions for other pieces of data such as family stories.
All of the tree data will be stored in a backend database, and an API will be exposed that the frontend can use to query the database. This follows the general structure of most modern web apps.

## Design Decisions

These decisions simultaneously comprise the main things that will differentiate FamilyStory from competitors and the things that spurred the development of this platform in the first place.

### Focus on Stories

Most platforms currently in existence focus primarily on the family tree as the centerpiece, with all other data (facts, stories, audio/video, etc) added off to the side and not as accessible as the tree.

This platform will weigh all of the stories and other data equally with the tree. After all, stories are the foundation of what makes a family unique, and (in my opinion) they should be the center of any platform that tracks a family.

So, while the family tree feature set will be well-developed, it will not be developed at the expense of all other features. The focus will be on the stories about the people in the tree.

This will be accomplished with three major features. 

First, stories will be independent of any particular person in a tree. In other geneaology platforms, any stories/facts you add are confined to a page specific to one person and are not easily accessible to users. FamilyStory will implement stories *alongside* family trees, instead of *inside* trees. 

Second, users will be able to tag multiple people from a family tree in a story so that other viewers will know exactly which people in the tree the story talks about. This further establishes the lack of a one-to-one relationship between stories and people; there could be many stories that tag the same person, but each one can also tag other people too. The goal is to create something that almost feels like a big family journal.

Finally, users will be able to browse family stories in a top-level view. When the page for a family is first opened, it will show both cards to go to tree viewers and a story browser.

### Family != Tree

The platform will be structured around families, not around family trees. There will not be a one-to-one relationship between the two.
Users will be able to create and maintain multiple "families", and each "family" will be able to contain multiple trees.

This may not be important for all users, but it's important to establish that trees are not the center of the "family" structure in the platform.
If a user wants to create multiple trees within one "family" (for example, one tree for their mom's side and another for their dad's side), then they can do so--*without* having to choose where to put stories and other data.

This also allows for stories to be added at a "family" level instead of a tree level, further driving home the point that stories are equally as important as family trees in this platform.

### Minimal User Interaction for Tree Viewer

There are a few common complaints about popular geneaology platforms' UI for viewing trees:

- Too many clicks to see specific branches of the tree
- Inability to view multiple/many branches of the tree simultaneously
- Reloading/revisiting the page resets tree state and requires users to go through lots of clicks again

To address these concerns, which are pretty major, the tree viewer will be implemented somewhat like the "infinite maps" in a game. When a user opens a tree, they will be taken to a canvas with the first few generations of the tree preloaded. Then, as they drag around the canvas, more people and branches will be dynamically loaded. Users will be able to scroll in and out to see more branches of the tree at a time.

This will *dramatically* reduce the amount of interactions required to view any specific person in the tree; instead of having to click through lots of buttons to expand branches, users can drag the canvas to view the branch they want. This design will also take care of the second concern, since users will be able to view as many branches/people as can fit on their screen; the app's UI will automatically render the tree in such a way that all people and branches are shown without visual overlap. Finally, the third concern will be indirectly resolved by the resolution of the first two: if it takes minimal interaction to navigate the tree, it won't matter that the tree resets each time it is reloaded. If necessary, a "stateful" solution can be developed post-MVP, but this should be good enough for the MVP.

## Task List

- [ ] Backend performance optimization to minimize time to load trees

### Add family stories

- [ ] Backend DB schemas for stories
