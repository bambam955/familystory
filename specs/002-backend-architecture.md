# Backend Architecture

TBD

## Design Decisions

### Language/Tooling: Golang

Golang is a programming language developed by Google that is billed as the "modern C". It's intentionally very simple compared to most modern programming languages: there is no OOP or advanced operators, less automatic memory management, less automatic threading, and so on. Unlike C, it has fantastically simple built-in support for asynchronous multithreaded routines and dynamic arrays, well-maintained prepackaged tooling such as a test runner and linter, and (hallelujah for this one) a standard *package manager* that provides access to a multitude of community-developed packages.

Golang was developed to be a systems programming language and, because of its simplicity and multithreading, is optimized for server-side applications. This makes it perfect for the backend of FamilyStory.

### Database: PostgreSQL

I think...

### REST API
